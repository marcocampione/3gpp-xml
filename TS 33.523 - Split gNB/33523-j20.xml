              <Purpose>To verify that activation of confidentiality protectionfor user data at the gNB is based on the security policy sent by the SMF via AMF.
Pre-Condition:
-	The gNB-CU-CP network product shall be connected in emulated/real network environments. The UE and the 5GC may be simulated.
-	The tester shall have access to the NG RAN air interface.
-	The tester shall have knowledge of the RRC and UP ciphering algorithm and protection keys and of the security keys, etc., needed to decrypt the messages on the E1 interface.
-	RRC ciphering is already activated at the gNB-CU-CP.</Purpose>
              <ExecutionSteps>All execution steps are to be performed two times. Once with the UP security policies’ ciphering protection in step 2 set to &quot;required&quot; and the second time set to &quot;not needed&quot;.
1.	The tester triggers PDU session establishment procedure by sending PDU session establishment request message.
2.	Tester shall trigger the SMF to send the UP security policy with ciphering protection &quot;required&quot; or &quot;not needed&quot; to the gNB-CU-CP.
3. 	The tester shall capture the Bearer Context Setup Request message sent to the gNB-CU-UP over the E1 interface.
4.	The tester shall capture the RRC Reconfiguration message sent by gNB-CU-CP to UE over NG RAN air interface.
5.	The tester shall retrieve the UP ciphering protection indication present in the captured messages.
6.	The tester shall verify if the UP ciphering policy received at gNB-CU-CP is same as the UP ciphering protection indication notified by the gNB-CU-CP to the UE in the RRC Reconfiguration message and the gNB-CU-UP in the Bearer Context Setup Request message.</ExecutionSteps>
              <ExpectedResults>Both the  RRC connection Reconfiguration message and Bearer Context Setup Request message indicate that ciphering is to be used in line with the policy received from the SMF.</ExpectedResults>
